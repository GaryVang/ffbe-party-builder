## What is Final Fantasy Brave Exvius (FFBE) Party Builder?

### Purpose

Organizing thoughts and parties can be quite difficult and tedious once a player has acquired a large number of units and equipment. The purpose of this project is to aid players in this process by allowing them to gear a unit while providing them with the necessary information in the most concise and user-friendly way possible.

On a more personal note, this project is a combination of my love of video games and programming. As someone that's learning JS and ReactJS, this project's purpose is to be used as a stepping stone in front-end and back-end development.
